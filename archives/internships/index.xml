      <description>During 6 weeks from june 2010 to july 2010, I did an intership in the complexnetwork team, at the Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris 6 in France. I worked under the supervision of Christophe Crespelle and Éric Fleury, to whom I owe a great deal.
Basically, the main topic of the internship was to find methods to analyze the diffusion process in a dynamic graph (fixed set of vertices, but edges added and removed dynamically).</description>

      <description>During 3 months from may to july 2011, I did an internship in the LIGUM team, at the Université de Montréal in Québec.
I worked under the supervision of Pierre Poulin, after having followed his introductory course in computer graphics for one session. The internship in itself had been very enriching, and I have to thanks my labmates for their dedication and their kindliness.
The main incentive of my internship was to develop a tool for generating solid textures of wood through growth simulation.</description>
