      <description>Because I&amp;rsquo;m keen on of competitive programming contests in the style of ACM-ICPC, I thought it might be of interest to present some of my favorite links on the topic.
Online Contests I did not participate in all the contests I mention, because I lacked the time or did not have knowledge of their existence before I became too old to participate. Nevertheless, they are here for the sake of completeness.</description>
