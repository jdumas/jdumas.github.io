      <description>Errata We would like to thank Julian Panetta for pointing out that our comparison with [Panetta et al. 2015] was using an incorrect tile. The new tile provided by the authors revealed an excellent isotropic behavior. As a result, we revised Section 5.1. In addition, we fixed an issue with Fig. 8b, and improved the accuracy of our homogenization implementation.

      <description>Slides The .pptx I used for my SIGGRAPH presentation. The file is huge (220 MB). Sorry, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a PowerPoint power-user, and the stuff contains video. If you hear about any cool presentation software with good cross-plaftorm video support, I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to hear about it!
Software An implementation of our method is now available in our modeling and slicing software IceSL. Please check it out and let us know what you think!</description>
